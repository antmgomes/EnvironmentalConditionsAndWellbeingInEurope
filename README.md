# Greener, Denser, Hotter: How Environment Shapes Wellbeing in Europe

## Introduction:
This project examines the relationship between environmental conditions (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, Population Density, and Average Mean Temperature) and human outcomes (Happiness Index, Good Health %, Life Expectancy and Suicide Rate) across European countries from 2015 to 2023.

## Key Questions:
* Are greener countries less populated?
* Do greener countries register lower temperatures?
* Do greener countries have healthier populations?
* Do the populations of greener countries live longer?
* Do less populated countries register higher suicide rates?
* Do countries with high temperatures have a happier population?
* Are the populations of northern European countries  happier?

## Key Variables
* happiness_index: Average national happiness score
* life_expectancy: Average Life expectancy at birth
* good_health_percentage: Percentage of population reporting good health
* ndvi: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (greenness)
* population_density: Total population (proxy for scale; density interpretation discussed in limitations)
* suicide_rate: Deaths by suicide per 100,000 people
* avg_mean_temp: Average Mean Temperature
